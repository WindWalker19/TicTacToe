# TicTacToe

Built a tictactoe game using HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,DOM and Vanilla Javascript.

It was a really fun project to gain more experience on how we could build a simple game using the front end web frame work and tools.

Below are the things to be considered to play this game:
1. The restart button is used to restart the game.
2. The check button is to check who has won.
3. If we click once in a box it's "X", if we click twice it's "O" and if we click thrice it's value is " ".
